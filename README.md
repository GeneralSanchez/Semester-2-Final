This is the start/end of the Semester 2 Final for the 2020/2021 school year at VVHS APCSA Period 5 class.

#2  Project Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 Project Description: The project Star Wars: Andy's Bootcamp is a bootcamp that is designed to brain wash Star Trek Fans into joining Star Wars.
With the Star Wars Fans they get to worry about anything due to the fact they are already in the greatest military ever of the Star Wars Universe.
The project is able to identify if the person using is a Star Wars fan or not and taking them to a special place for each of them.
Also this project is something that makes Star Trek fans rethink why they are doing with science nerds and not the people that have everthing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 How to Play: To play the user must first answer every single question that is used by the JOption first so that the program runs and
everthing after that would show. The user will be ask different question which can be true or false, a word or number,and depending the option 
of Jedi,Sith,or Army then more questions. Then when evertything is filled then the console will fill itslef if you are a Star Wars fan,but ig 
the user is a Star Trek fan then they will have to type a list something the Star Wars Fans don't have to do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 Special Features: Some of the special features of the prgram it can distinguish a Star Trek fan from a Star Wars fan is two different ways.
If the user answers true to being a star wars fan or if they give a ranking of over 75 the program takes them to a specifc feature of having to rate
each of the movies. These grades then get ir order by the alhabet which get reorganized which is another special feature of the program. Then we get 
a special song to show how much love there is to Star Wars fans and those that are not int hem get a special treat. The user gets a special ID due
to the rank they choose and the ID they choose for themselves.

#6 Reflection
Some of the things that I can reflect in is that this prohram allowed me to experiment with something that is out of what I thought that I could do.
Even though maybe so of the code may be lagging I know that it can be developed even more to find the code that is crashing which with my eyes 
at the momment could not find it. I know this can become a greater code because I developed it and I have the knowledge to get there.  Hqaving these
things fixed would allow to get the code working and allow the user to experience the bootcamp better.
